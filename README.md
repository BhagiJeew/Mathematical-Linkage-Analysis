# Mathematical-Linkage-Analysis
Mathematical Linkage Analysis (MLA) derived from graph theory can be used to identify significant points of each item based on a single variable. This is a method which is an alternative to clustering. This method considers, each items behavior separately and identify the significant points, so that values need not to be filtered based on a previously determined common value, but each item is uniquely evaluated.


As of MLA Initially, the variable value of each item are arranged in descending order based on the given values (Values should be proportionated from the total existing)  which is introduced as the real configuration. MLA compares the real configurations to idea-typical configuration in which the proportion is similar over exactly first, second, third… variable of each item. In other words, in the first ideal-typical condition only one point is there; in the second situation two points are there where the proportion is equal in both points. Next, the R-sq between the real distribution and each of the ideal-typical condition is calculated. The no of points in the iteration with the largest R-sq value gives the number of significant points.
